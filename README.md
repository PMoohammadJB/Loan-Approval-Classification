this is a simple Loan Approval Prediction project which i have used three traditional models for it.
LogisticRegression, KNN, ANN
one interesting thing i tried is that rescaling the data didnt make any change for LogisticRegression
actually LogisticRegression is not affected from data scaling.
features in this data are :

'Gender', 'Married', 'Dependents', 'Education', 'Self_Employed',
       'ApplicantIncome', 'CoapplicantIncome', 'LoanAmount',
       'Loan_Amount_Term', 'Credit_History', 'Property_Area', 'Loan_Status'
